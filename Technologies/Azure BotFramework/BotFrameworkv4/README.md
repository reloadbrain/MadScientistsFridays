#BotBuilder v4 SDK is now publicly available on GitHub! 

[Bot Builder v4 SDK] (https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/wiki) builds on the feedback and learnings from the prior Bot Builder SDKs and introduces the right levels of abstraction, while enabling rich componentization of the bot building blocks. 
The 4.x version is actively being developed and should be used for experimentation purposes only at this time - production bots should continue to be developed using the v3 SDK.  
With the v4 SDK, we are all-in on OSS development and have an amazing [Wiki] (https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/wiki), a solid [Roadmap] (https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/wiki/roadmap), and [FAQ](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/wiki/FAQ).
